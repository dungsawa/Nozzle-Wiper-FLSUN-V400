# Nozzle-Wiper-FLSUN-V400
A compact nozzle cleaning module, positioned outside the printable area. Ensures effective filament residue removal while maintaining full build volume, with easy removal and cleaning.

# I use the silicone brush from the Bambu Lab A1

# If you experience the servo jittering during operation, try switching to another 5V PWM signal pin.

# Since this is the first version, there are still some flaws, but overall it works well. If you have any suggestions, please share them with me.
